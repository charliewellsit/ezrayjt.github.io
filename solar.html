        <h2>Decide if solar power is right for you</h2>
        <img id='img3' src="Front_end/images/solar1.jpeg">
        <p>If you’re considering switching to solar energy, you’ll want to first determine if it’s the right choice for
            your home. Before making any decisions, you should weigh the pros and cons.</p>

        <p>One of the main benefits of using solar energy is that it is a renewable resource. Sunlight is free, so once
            your panels are installed, you won’t have to worry about skyrocketing electricity bills. Additionally, by
            utilizing the sun’s energy, you can significantly reduce your carbon footprint.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the cost of solar panel installation can be expensive upfront. To offset the cost of
            installation, many homeowners choose to lease their solar panel systems from a third-party provider. This
            could result in lower energy bills, however, there are associated costs and long-term contracts associated
            with this option.</p>

        <p>You should also consider factors such as the amount of sunshine your home receives, the orientation of your
            roof, and the age of your roof when determining if solar power is right for you. If your roof is shaded or
            covered by trees, solar energy may not be feasible. Additionally, older roofs may need to be upgraded before
            solar panels can be installed.</p>

        <p>Overall, <strong>solar power</strong> can be an excellent choice if it’s the right fit for your home. Doing
            research and weighing your options will help ensure that you make an informed decision that best suits your
            needs.</p>

        <h2>Choose a reputable company</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Research the company’s credentials, including the length of time they have been in business and their
                customer reviews</li>
            <li>Look for experience in installing the type of solar panels you are interested in</li>
            <li>Ensure the company is licensed and insured to work in your area</li>
            <li>Check the company’s Better Business Bureau rating</li>
            <li>Make sure the company follows safety guidelines</li>
            <li>Find out if the company is committed to using high-quality materials</li>
            <li>Inquire about the warranties on their products and services</li>
            <li>Determine if they provide maintenance or repairs after installation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understand the contract</h2>

        <p>It’s important to thoroughly read and understand the contract before signing. Understand the details of the
            payment plan, who is responsible for maintenance, warranties and guarantees, and any other special clauses
            included. Make sure you ask questions and get clarifications if there is something you don’t understand or
            disagree with. The contractor should be willing to answer your questions in a timely manner.</p>

        <p>Pay attention to the fine print. Check for things like early termination fees and cancellation policies. Be
            sure that the terms are clear and that all of the details are laid out explicitly. Ask for copies of all
            documents, including contracts and permits, so you have them on record.</p>

        <p>Understand the legal obligations associated with the solar panel installation. This includes the local and
            state regulations related to the installation process, as well as any applicable HOA rules or other
            restrictions that may apply.</p>

        <p>The solar panel installation contract should also include information on how long it will take to install the
            panels and when you can expect to begin seeing savings from the switch to solar power. It should also
            clearly outline any obligations that you have to keep the panels functioning properly throughout their
            lifetime.</p>

        <p>Make sure you understand the terms of the contract before signing it. Ask questions and make sure everything
            is clear. Getting these details right will help ensure a smooth transition to solar power and prevent any
            problems down the line.</p>
