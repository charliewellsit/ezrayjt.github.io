        <h2>The Purpose of Composting:</h2>
        <p>Gardening and farming disrupt the natural pattern of the return of plant matter to the earth. Compost is the
            link between modern agriculture and nature's own method of building soil fertility.</p>

        <p>In addition to returning rotting vegetable material to the soil, there are two major reasons for making
            compost:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>to render certain materials such as manure and garbage pleasant to handle</li>
            <li>to increase the nitrogen content of low-nitrogen materials such as sawdust, straw, and corncobs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The high heat of composting rapidly "cooks" the smell out of manure and garden waste. This is a significant
            gain because gardeners are often reluctant to use those materials "fresh".</p>

        <p>The composting process also increases the nitrogen content of the pile. Microorganisms "burn off" much of the
            carbon, reducing the cubic bulk of the heap but correspondingly increasing its nitrogen portion.</p>

        <p>Organic matter is valuable to the soil only while it is decaying. Even finished compost is actually only
            partly decayed. It continues to break down in the soil, providing food for increasing populations of
            microorganisms upon which your plant health depends. Pound per pound (kg per kg) compost is the finest soil
            conditioner to be had.</p>

        <h3>How To Make Compost</h3>

        <p>Making compost is not difficult and can be easily done at home. Essentially, the basic methods call for
            layering natural ingredients in heaps in mixed proportions, providing necessary air and moisture, and
            turning the heaps to provide bacterial action on all parts of the heap.</p>

        <p>Just about any organic matter can be used. Weeds, fruit and vegetable peelings, grass, garden clippings, dead
            flowers, sawdust, woodchips, coffee wastes, nutshells, shredded leaves, and more can all be used provided
            they are chemical, pesticide, and herbicide-free. Also, do not use feces, or dead animals. In short, think
            to yourself, "Do I really want to eat this?"</p>

        <p>Compost can be made either in open piles or in bins. Piles are more easily turned, but bins have a better
            appearance in the garden. Bins also have the advantage of better moisture and temperature control.
            Personally, I have found beginning with a pit in the garden seems to work best, as it attracts earthworms to
            help with the breakdown of the materials, plus you can turn it easily.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Whichever method you choose, select a sunny spot and begin by putting down a 6-inch layer of plant
                wastes such as spoiled hay, straw, sawdust, plant leaves (shredding them first helps), garden clippings,
                or wood chips</li>
            <li>Add a 2-inch layer of manure and bedding</li>
            <li>Follow with a layer of topsoil, approximately 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        </ol>
