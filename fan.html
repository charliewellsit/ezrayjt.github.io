        <h2>Ceiling Fan Installation Guide</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Before you begin check to make sure you have the necessary tools to get the job done. You will of course need
            the ceiling fan and any parts that came in the box with it. You will also need a ladder, screwdriver, wire
            tester, pliers, wire cutters, a mask and goggles. By having all the tools ready you will save yourself time
            and frustration from having to start and stop the project while you locate yet another tool you need.</p>

        <h2>Existing wiring?</h2>
        <p>Before you begin you should read all the instructions that can in your ceiling fan box. Since ceiling fans
            are usually used to replace or update an existing light fixture all the wiring should already be done for
            you. If you are installing a new fan in a non-wired location and do not have a clue about wiring please for
            your own safety consult a professional. One thing you must do before you do any wiring or installation is to
            make sure the power is off and no one will turn it back on until you are finished.</p>

        <h2>Measure twice cut once!</h2>
        <p>After the electricity is off and your sure no one will turn it back on you need to first remove the existing
            light fixture. Many times this is simply done by unscrewing a few screws and disconnecting the wires. Next
            you will need to measure and possibly cut the correct size hole. Remember the rule of thumb: Measure twice
            cut once. This will save you from making the mistake of cutting the hole too big to fit the fan you have
            purchased.</p>

        <h2>Install New electrical box</h2>
        <p>Next you will need to install the new electrical box that came in the box with your new ceiling. You will
            then need to glue on the ceiling medallion if your ceiling fan has one, if not skip to the next step. After
            the medallion is in place attach the ceiling plate. Take special care to make sure the screws are tight.
            Loose screws are one of the common issues a fan will make noise when it is on.</p>

        <h2>Ceiling fan Components</h2>
        <p>Then you will need to assemble the ceiling fan components. By following the ceiling fan instructions this
            should be a simple job. Then you will take the components up the ladder to connect the wires from the
            ceiling to the ceiling fan. Securely mount your ceiling fan to the ceiling again taking special care to make
            sure the screws are in securely to reduce any noise the fan might make when it is working.</p>

        <h2>Final step</h2>
        <p>The final step when installing your ceiling fan is the attach the blades and the light fixture. You will also
            need to pay special attention to securing the blades to the base of the fan. Once
            you have completed all of these steps you can turn your electricity back on and start enjoying the breeze
            from your brand new fan.</p>
